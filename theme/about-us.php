His son Ankush, a graduate from Shri Ram College of Commerce, grew up watching his father serving the mankind and developed a keen interest in all that’s herbal. Addveda was born when Ankush decided to look at the bigger picture and do something that’d help those who’re in need across the world and not just in India. He wanted to take the wisdom of Ayurveda to the world, offering authentic Ayurvedic products and herbs for almost every ailment under the sun.</p>
